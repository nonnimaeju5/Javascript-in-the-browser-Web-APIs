# Javascript-in-the-browser-Web-APIs (Speciality Guide)
This is a project done for Vefskólinn course. For the speciality guide i chose coding a movie app.

## Movie app functionality
I decided to do a movie based app and it is a single-page web application. 
I am going to add too it later on as i want to make it as a app that members of the Skjaldborgarbíó can use.


## The Movie App allows users to do the following:
1. You can search all movies from the database that you want to know more about.
2. See rating that each movie got. 
3. Overview text that tells you about each movie when you hover over it.

## Later on i want to add some of those functions:
View popular, now playing, upcoming and top rated movies.
View Individual movies and get the movie data such as cast, movie duration, summary, recommended movies,etc.
View popular People.
View Individual Persons and get thier details.
Search for Actors.
