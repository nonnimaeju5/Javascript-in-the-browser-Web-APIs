# Javascript-in-the-browser-Web-APIs


Speciality Guide:
I decided to do a movie based app and used a tutorial on youtube from Asish George (link below).
I did a much more simplyfied version and decided on having the ability to search movies, seeing their rating,
along getting and overview text about each movie when you hover over it.

I feel like a learned alot from this project and had fun using these APIs to get the information needed for my site to work.
